<img src="/images/fulls/curie.jpg" class="fit image"> I stopped liking Maths, Physics and Chemistry in 5th Grade. I was told that I should stick to what I was good at and try not to fail in the sciences. I was surely "not made" to succeed in these fields, and thus, why bother get excited about them.

It took me at least 15 years to get over my aversion to Mathematics and Physical Sciences. It's kind of sad, because know I am utterly fascinated by it and would have loved to learn all about Numbers, Theorems, Atoms and Forces. I remember that learning he Periodic Table was a particular pain because except for a few elements that I knew about, most of them didn't mean anything to me. It was just a matter of learning by heart.

When I got into programming, I also started re-evaluating my stance towards Maths and the Sciences. Is it too late to learn and feed my budding interest in science? I decided that the answer must be a resounding no.

Moreover, I want kids and other learners to loose their inhibitions towards the sciences, so that they don't go through life without learning how utterly fascinating it all is.

*tl,dr;* The fabulous and super-smart Katrin Marschner and I started to create a single page web app written in React that would provide an interactive experience of the Periodic Table of Elements.

*Facts and Figures*
- App uses React / Babel
- We created our own styles in Sass
- Data is delivered as JSON via Node (REST API)
